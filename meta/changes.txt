- [BRK] Moved Web\Factory and Web\Front to Web\Controller\Factory and
  Web\Controller\Front, respectively.

- [CHG] Updated to use new package versions.

- [FIX] Cli\MakeTest\Command::action() now errors when no package file path is
  specified.

- [NEW] CLI script to set up and run a development server using the built-in
  PHP server.

- [FIX] Web\Controller\Front::request() now extracts path from REQUEST_URI
